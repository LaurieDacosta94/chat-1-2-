# Agent Instructions

- Prefer cross-platform solutions when editing scripts.
- Document any non-obvious behavior directly in code comments.
- Run relevant npm or Node.js scripts when modifying JavaScript files, when possible.
- Before finishing changes, execute `./scripts/setup-and-run.sh` to validate the end-to-end experience unless a task explicitly states otherwise.
